## Measurement of disclosure risk and information loss 
### Disclosure risk

The key measure of dislosure risk in the case of magnitude tables is based on the $(n,l)$-dominance or $p\%$ rules. In many formal regulations or recommendations it is assumed $n=1$ and $l=75$. Very often $(n,l)$ dominance is combined with $k$-anonymity: a cell is regarded as unsafe if it violates the $k$-anonymity or the $(n,l)$-dominance. Therefore the dislosure risk can be measured as the share of cells violating the finally assumed principle.  

However, this assessment concerns only the primary risk. One should take into account the risk of secondary re-identification of unit. Antal, Shlomo and Elliot (2014), formulate four fundamental properties which should have an efficient disclosure risk measure: 
(a) small cell values have higher disclosure risk thanlarge values; (b) uniformly distributed frequencies imply low disclosure risk; (c) the morezero cells in the census table, the higher the disclosure risk; (d) the risk measure should bebounded by 0 and 1.
Shlomo, Antal and Elliot (2015) proposed in this context measure based on the entropy. According to their approach, a high entropy indicates that the distribution across cells is uniform and a low entropy indicates mainly zeros in a row/column or table with a few non-zero cells. The fewer the number of non-zero cells, the more likely that attribute disclosure occurs. The entropy is given as
$$
H=-\sum_{i=1}^{k}{\frac{c_i}{n}\cdot\log{\frac{c_i}{n}}}, (4.6.1)
$$
where $c_i$ is the number of units contained in $i$-th cell and $n$ is the total number of cells in the table. The measure (4.6.1) is next normalized to the form
$$
1-\frac{H}{\log n}.
$$
