## Measurement of disclosure risk and information loss 
### Disclosure risk

The key measure of dislosure risk in the case of magnitude tables is based on the $(n,l)$-dominance or $p\%$ rules. In many formal regulations or recommendations it is assumed $n=1$ and $l=75$. Very often $(n,l)$ dominance is combined with $k$-anonymity: a cell is regarded as unsafe if it violates the $k$-anonymity or the $(n,l)$-dominance. Therefore the dislosure risk can be measured as the share of cells violating the finally assumed principle.  

However, this assessment concerns only the primary risk. One should take into account the risk of secondary re-identification of unit. Shlomo, Antal and Elliot (2015)
