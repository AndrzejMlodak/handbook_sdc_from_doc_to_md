A first complete review was made (thanks to violeta for the help). All the equations and figures should be in place now.

It's time for a deeper review on each chapter. For each mistake, typo, etc. detected, the best option is to open a new issue mentionning the chapter and section (and sufficiently info to locate the problem) and describing what has to be done to fix the problem.

On my side, it remains some work on cross-referenced sections / equations /figures and tables. The numbers of referenced were hard-written in the original document and it's not very easy to maintain.
