## Introduction

Although very sophisticated methods have been developed to make safe micro data files, the needs of serious researchers for more detailed data cannot be met by these methods. It is simply impossible to release these very detailed micro data sets to users outside the control of the NSIs without breaching the necessary confidentiality protection. Nevertheless the NSIs recognize the serious and respectable requests by the research community for access to the very rich and valuable micro data sets of the NSIs. Therefore different initiatives have been taken by the NSIs to meet these needs.

The first step was the creation of so-called safe data research centres, a special room in the NSI, where researchers can analyse the data sets, without the option to export any information without the consent of the NSI. In parallel to this initiative there are options for remote execution. Remote execution facilities are various kinds of systems where researchers can submit scripts for SAS, SPSS etc to the NSI. The most recent initiative is remote access, where users can "log in" to a research centre from a remote desktop.

As all these options allow the researcher to access unprotected sensitive data in some way, all possible precautions have to be taken. These options are certainly not available to the general public, but only to selected research institutes like universities and similar research institutes. Additionally, strict contracts have to be signed between the NSI and the researcher. Preferably also the research institute itself should sign the contract. This enables the NSI to take action against the institute itself as well as against the researcher, if something might go wrong. A common repercussion for the institute could be a ban for the whole institute to access these facilities. So it will be in the interest of the institute to ensure a correct behaviour of the researcher.
