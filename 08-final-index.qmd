[^4]: Some of the main observed variables are in the CIS3 are : principal economic activity, geographical information, number of employees in 1998 and 2000, turnover in 1998 and 2000, exports in 1998 and 2000, gross investment in tangible goods: 2000, number of valid patents at end of 2000, number of employees with higher education (in line with the number of employees in 2000), expenditure in intramural RD (in line with the turnover in 2000), expenditure in extramural RD (in line with the turnover in 2000), expenditure in acquisition of machinery (in line with the turnover in 2000), expenditure in other external knowledge (in line with the turnover in 2000), expenditure in training, market (in line with the turnover in 2000), total innovation expenditure (in line with the turnover in 2000), number of persons involved in intra RD (in line with the number of employees in 2000).

[^7]: One of the secondary cell suppression methods of t-ARGUS, the hypercube method, uses an elaborate internal weighting scheme in order to avoid to some extent the suppression of totals and subtotals which is essential for the performance of the method. In order to avoid that this internal weighting scheme is thrown out of balance, it has been decided to make the cost function facilities of t-ARGUS inoperational for this method.

[^8]: Consider for instance the table of example 3 in section 4.2.2 . Without additional knowledge the bounds for cell (1,1) are ![](Images/media/image196.png) = 3 and ![](Images/media/image197.png) = 6 . However, if cell (1,2) were a singleton-cell (a cell with a single contributor only) then this single contributor could of course exactly compute the cell value of cell (1,1) by subtracting her own contribution from the row total of row 1.
